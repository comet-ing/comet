# JAM-BACKEND

This is backend for JAM Cartesi dApp written in JavaScript. It uses node to execute the backend application.
The application entrypoint is the `src/index.js` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.

##  Steps to run the node locally
1. cd in project backend directory and install node packages
```
yarn && yarn install
```
2. Run cartesi build
```
cartesi build
```
3. Turn up the node
```
cartesi run --epoch-duration=10
```
4. Deploy ERC1155 smart contract - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and copy `contracts/SimpleERC1155.sol` file to Remix project. Compile, select environment as `Injected Provider - Metamask` and hit deploy. Copy the deployed contract address.

5. In a separate terminal tab, use `cartesi send generic` to set the address of the NFT contract deployed in step #4. The input JSON string to use below:
```
{"action":"jam.setNFTAddress", "address":"deployed-nft-contract-address"}
```
6. Use `cartesi send` to set the address of the dApp contract. Select Option available as `Send DApp address input to the application.`

7. Environment is now set, proceed for app inputs. Some input actions with json examples are given below.
